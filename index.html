	<p>I am a senior statistics student at The Ohio State University. Working with data and analyzing the impact of events is a passion of mine as I work to become a data scientist after graduating from Ohio State in May 2021. </p>
	<p>My coursework at Ohio State includes classes in statistics (18 hours completed by Dec. 2020), mathematics (19 hours), business (12 hours), computer science (11 hours), and German (15 hours). </p>
	<p>In addition to my coursework, I have had the opportunity to expand my education outside of Columbus. I studied abroad in Budapest, Hungary, in May of last summer, learning about the complex history and culture of Central Europe. I also had the opportunity to travel to London in my freshman year as a part of Ohio State's Honor's London program.</p> 
	<p>I have work experience with <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/">JPMorgan Chase and Co.</a>, the second-largest bank in the world and the global leader in financial services, <a href="https://www.elevenwarriors.com/">Eleven Warriors</a>, a Columbus-based sports website that focuses on Ohio State athletics, and <a href="https://www.matcotools.com/">Matco Tools</a>, a leading tool distribution company and subsidiary of Fortive Corporation.</p>  
	<p>To go with my professional work experience, I have worked on a number of personal projects. In my most recent project, I created a <a href="https://ohio-state-statistics.shinyapps.io/Ohio-State-Stats/">web application</a> to easily visualize some of the best individual seasons by an Ohio State player in its history. Season statistics are available for nearly 1,500 Buckeyes, with more data and features on the way.</p>
	<p>Another major personal project includes my extensive work with Spotify's API. I have used natural language processing to analyze The Weeknd's discography, analyzing song-to-song and album-to-album themes. Additionally, I have used the API to investigate my own listening habits as well as use unsupervised machine learning to find the number of song clusters present in my playlist. Other personal projects include work with the NFL's player tracking data, determining which collegiate program develops the best NFL players at the wide receiver position with advanced analytics, and simulating basketball games. </p>
