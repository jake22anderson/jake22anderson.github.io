	<p>Hello! I am a senior data scientist at <a href="https://www.8451.com/">84.51°</a> on the Supplier Impact Maximization team. I graduated from Ohio State in 2021 with a B.S. in Statistics and a minor in business analytics. Outside of work, I love to ski, travel, and hike.</p>
	<p>My current work includes tracking supplier and Kroger investment across a number of different advertising channels and determining the optimal allocation of those investment dollars. Most of my work revolves around data aggregation and cleaning, optimization, and data engineering. I also work with our models and QA. Additionally, I prototyped SIM's functionality for semantic kernel functions in 2024 via OpenAI's 4o model.</p>p>
	<p>This past summer, I was the data science intern program manager. I managed and evaluated 11 data science interns and worked closely with a number of managers across the company to ensure the best possible experience for everyone involved. </p>
	<p>My previous work in my current role includes developing, executing, and delivering custom solutions to our clients. This includes developing new solutions involving causal inference, creating dashboards in Tableau and Power BI, introducing new data sources to existing solutions, and delivering our work directly to clients.</p>
	<p>My coursework at Ohio State includes classes in statistics (33 hours, courses include: Bayesian Analysis and Statistical Decision Making, Computational Statistics, Time Series Modeling and Analysis),  mathematics (19 hours, courses include: Linear Algebra, Quanitative Neuroscience, Dynamical Systems), business (15 hours, courses include: Sports Analytics, Applied Prescriptive Analytics), computer science (11 hours, courses include: Software One and Two), and German (15 hours, courses include: German Three, Representation and Memory of the Holocaust in Film). </p>
	<p>In addition to my coursework, I have had the opportunity to expand my education outside of Columbus. I studied abroad in Budapest, Hungary, in May of last summer, learning about the complex history and culture of Central Europe. I also had the opportunity to travel to London in my freshman year as a part of Ohio State's Honor's London program.</p> 
	<p>Additionally, I have taken a number of DataCamp's assessments, scoring in the 93rd percentile in "Machine Learning Fundamentals in R", the 85th percentile in "R Programming", the 84th percentile in "Cleaning and Importing Data in R", and the 83rd percentile in "Data Manipulation in R". I have also taken two <a href = 'https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/94427/linkedin-skill-assessments?lang=en'>LinkedIn assessments</a>, passing the tests for Programming in R and Machine Learning. </p>
